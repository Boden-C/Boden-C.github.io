        <h1>This is a test</h1>
        <p>This code is only to used to test scheduling practices for further experimentation.</p>
        <p>If for some reason you want to test this, open console (ctrl-shift-i) and input</p>
        <code>test() //if you want to use a realistic selection (currently generates 690 schedules in ~70 ms)</code>
        <br />
        <code>generateSchedules(getData(), &lt;array of class codes&gt;) //if you want to use random data</code>
        <p>
            NOTE: the array of class codes is formatted as
            <code>["TA2S3A", "LA3E4A", "MA3CBA", "SS3GVC", "MA3STA", "SC3PCA", "PP17SA", "PP18SA"]</code>. The codes and
            data is used from a long time ago as the current/last years data is still not given. Period 0 is ignored.
        </p>
        <p>THIS IS NOT QA TESTED, don't do obviously impossible things</p>
