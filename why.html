    <h1>Why a Digital Portfolio is Important</h1>
    <h2>(This page has little decoration as it is temporary and the final professional digital portfolio would be a reflection of skills, whether they exist or not)</h2>
    <P>In this age of technology, businesses now look for proof of their skill instead of merely taking your word for it.
        While it can be difficult to show your skills, a good way of doing so is using documentation of your past projects.
        Applying in the competitive field of computer science requires you to show your programming skills, best done with a portfolio of your comprehension and projects in computer science.
        Employers can now look at your past code and either see your skills, improvements, and adaptability.
        Therefore, having a place to show all your coding projects is important to show your coding and other skills.</P>
