                transmits information between the clients and servers. The
                information in HTTP is stored in plain text, so anyone who

                >The TLS handshake is an exchange of vital data between the web

                >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first step
                of the handshake is the versions, cipher, and algorithms to be
                used in the future. Once this is agreed upon, the server must
                prove that this server is authentic by sending a Digital
                Certificate. The body of the certificate includes various data,
                including serial numbers, valid dates, versions, algorithms,
                ciphers, the subject, and the issuer of the certificate, which
                is the Certification Authority that authorizes them. The server
                also sends its public key to prepare for data decryption. All of
                this is signed by the aforementioned Certification Authority
                with a Digital Signature to prove the certification is
                authentic.</span

                >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To decrypt
                information, a key must be used. However, sending the key in a
                symmetrical system where only one key is used is dangerous if it
                is sent in plain text. An asymmetrical design is used with a
                private and public key to solve this. The public key can only
                decrypt data encrypted from its corresponding private key and
                vice versa. However, outsiders cannot decipher the private from
                the public key, so it is safe to give the public key as long as
                the private key is kept secure. The client receives the
                certificate with the public key, and once it verifies the
                certificate to be genuine, it generates a symmetric key pair to
                be used in further messages. The user&rsquo;s key is encrypted
                with the server&rsquo;s public key and sent to the server,
                meaning that only the server can decrypt and read the
                user&rsquo;s key. Upon completion of the handshake, both the
                server and client have a symmetrical key that either can use to
                decrypt and encrypt data.</span

                >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the
                client sends their key, however, they need to trust that the
                certificate isn&rsquo;t fake. The client relies upon Certificate
                Authorities, trusted third-party sources who sign with their
                Digital Signature, to confirm that the web server and public key
                are authentic. To create the Digital Signature in this context,
                the Digital Certificate is first hashed - meaning irreversibly,
                cryptographically transforming the data into a fixed-length
                value. Hashing is usually done with a highly secure hash such as
                Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit (SHA-256). A hash generally needs
                to change dramatically with minor updates and be relatively
                unique to be secure. The value is then encrypted with the
                Certificate Authority&rsquo;s private key, completing the
                Digital Signature. The signature is then sent along with the
                Digital Certificate to the client. On the client side, the
                Digital Certificate they received is hashed following the
                earlier agreed upon hash during the first part of the handshake,
                then compared with the Digital Signature decrypted with the
                Certification Authority&rsquo;s public key stored on the
                client&rsquo;s computer. If the signatures match, then the
                client is sure that the certificate was issued by the actual
                Certificate Authority and not altered, as the public key can
                only decrypt its corresponding private key, which they should
                hold.</span

                >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As more
                websites begin using HTTPS instead of unencrypted HTTP,
                organizations find it harder to see the user&#39;s data to
                either use, store, or check that they comply with their policy.
                To counteract this, these organizations use a man in the middle
                attack to read your information even if the website uses a
                secure HTTPS connection. A man in the middle attack is a general
                term for someone who positions themselves in the middle of a
                conversation to siphon information away while still giving
                information to the other side, so nothing seems wrong. The
                attack presents a risk to the client as they would not assume
                that their organization is spying on them as the interaction
                still seems normal. On the internet, the attack can be achieved
                through an HTTPS Proxy Appliance, which in this context refers
                to a fake server set up between the actual server and the
                client. When clients ask for a website, the organization&rsquo;s
                network can redirect them to their HTTPS Proxy Appliance. For
                the client to trust the proxy, however, a general TLS handshake
                still has to occur. However, this time, the proxy sends a fake
                Digital Certificate with a fake Certificate Authority
                authorizing said certificate. Usually, the client&rsquo;s
                computer would not trust the fake Certificate Authority as it
                does not recognize it. However, if the organization also
                controls the computer, it can add the phony authority to the
                list of trusted authorities and their corresponding public key.
                If they do this, the client&rsquo;s computer cannot recognize
                the illegitimacy of the Certificate Authority, and therefore,
                the handshake continues with the proxy. The client sends their
                key as usual, and now the proxy can decrypt all information sent
                by the client to store or interpret. To create an aura of
                normalcy, the proxy establishes another connection with the
                actual server, completes a different TLS handshake, and sends
                the user data encrypted with the proxy/server key to the server.
                When the server responds with new information, the proxy
                decrypts the data, reads it, then encrypts it again with the
                proxy/client key and sends it to the client. If done correctly,
                the client would not suspect anything.</span

                >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that
                although compliance with the policy is essential, the
                fundamental right of privacy should still hold, and schools,
                governments, or Internet Service Providers should not have a
                right to have unrestricted access to all information sent by you
                without evidence of illegal acts. Although this behavior usually
                cannot be prevented as the organization can force this exchange,
                detection is possible. This is because the certificate exchanged
                with the proxy would not match the actual certificate exchanged
                with the server. A simple way of comparing certificates is with
                a &ldquo;fingerprint&rdquo;, also called a
                &ldquo;thumbprint,&rdquo; which is a hash of a certificate and,
                therefore, should be unique for each certificate. The
                fingerprint is similar to the Digital Signature but is usually
                not used in the computer&rsquo;s verification process. The
                fingerprint is often generated afterward and is often for the
                user. The fingerprint can still be in SHA-1 instead of SHA-256,
                as the security aspect is not as vitally important, and SHA-1 is
                good enough for the client to use. The user can compare this
                fingerprint to a list of verified authentic fingerprints. If the
                fingerprints don&rsquo;t match, it indicates that the
                certificates are different and that you might be connecting to a
                proxy server that is spying on you. A false positive is when the
                fingerprint is different, but the reality is that it is still
                safe. Massive companies, such as Amazon or Google, use multiple
                authenticators and various certificates. Malware applications
                can also purposefully intercept information to scan for viruses,
                such as BitDefender and Kaspersky A/V. Strange web
                configurations creating multiple certificates for almost
                identical addresses or proxy servers that do not steal
                information can also be considered a false positive.</span
            >
        </p>
        <p class="c5 c9">
            <span
                >On the other hand, false negatives are when a fingerprint is
                the same, and the client marks it as negative for any
                interception, but in reality, it is not. After ruling out human
                error, this is almost impossible unless the proxy has somehow
                obtained the Certificate Authority&rsquo;s private key. There is
                a hypothetical chance that if you use SHA-1 to compare
                fingerprints, such as the list of authentic fingerprints in
                grc.com, there can be a duplicate fingerprint with different
                certificates. Despite being nearly impossible, security experts
                still transitioned the critical hashes, such as the Digital
                Signature, to SHA-256. This is to maintain security and privacy
                on the internet, attempting to make a secure connection actually
                secure.</span
