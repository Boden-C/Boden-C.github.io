                &emsp;This week, our group continued to work on developing a software stock market AI predictor. We
                encountered some technical challenges, such as debugging errors and ensuring the algorithm was

                &emsp;This week, our team worked hard on developing a software stock market AI predictor. As we
                progressed, we encountered a few technical challenges, including debugging and optimizing our
                algorithms. Additionally, scheduling challenges arose as we struggled to find common times for meetings
                and coordinate deadlines. However, perhaps the biggest obstacle we faced were the interpersonal
                challenges that emerged. Communication breakdowns and personality conflicts slowed our progress and
                created tension within the team. Despite these challenges, we remain committed to completing the project
                to the best of our abilities and hope to overcome these obstacles moving forward.

                predictor. One of the main technical challenges was integrating various APIs to retrieve the necessary
                data for the predictor to function effectively. Another challenge was scheduling, as it was difficult to
                find a time that worked for everyone to meet and discuss our progress. Interpersonal challenges also
                arose, as different opinions and ideas clashed during group discussions. However, we were able to

                &emsp;This week, our group faced several challenges while developing an AI predictor for the stock
                market. Technical difficulties arose as we struggled to fine-tune our algorithms, resulting in delays in
                the project timeline. Additionally, scheduling conflicts caused some members to miss meetings, leading
                to confusion and miscommunication. Interpersonal challenges also emerged, as differing opinions on
                project direction caused tension within the group. Despite these challenges, we were able to collaborate
                and find solutions to keep the project moving forward. We remain optimistic and committed to delivering

                Technical challenges included debugging code and addressing inconsistencies in data sets, while

                challenges related to communication breakdowns and differing opinions on project direction. Despite
                these obstacles, we were able to address most of these issues through collaborative problem-solving and

                &emsp;In the fast-paced and ever-evolving world of software development, one of the greatest challenges
                facing project teams is the need for collaboration among individuals who may have different

                &emsp;In any software project, the collaboration among team members is crucial. Despite having a common
                goal, it is not uncommon to face difficulties in finding common ground, especially when team members
                bring their own unique approaches and personalities to the table. These differences can sometimes lead
                to interpersonal conflicts, which can hinder the progress of the project. However, I believe that with a
                positive attitude and a willingness to compromise, we can overcome these challenges and work together
                effectively. Regular communication and team building activities can help to foster a positive working

                would face was ensuring compatibility between the various software systems we were using. Despite
                extensive research and testing, we encountered numerous issues with data transfer and integration
                between our chosen programming languages and databases. This required significant problem-solving and
                debugging efforts, as well as multiple redesigns and adjustments to our overall system architecture.
                Despite these obstacles, we were ultimately able to overcome this challenge and successfully implement a

                &emsp;Software Development Engineer is the main engineer who focuses on the development and design of
                computer systems, applications, and software. They are responsible for the creation and maintenance of
                software systems, including writing, testing, and debugging code. This is usually a generic role that
                requires skills in programming and therefore most programmers so most programmers are suitable for the
                role. Most complications are intrapersonal with this role so research would usually suffice.

                &emsp;A QA Engineer (Quality Assurance Engineer) is responsible for testing and ensuring the quality of
                software products. They are involved in the software development process from the beginning to the end,
                and work closely with software developers and other stakeholders to identify and resolve defects. They
                usually require rigorous testing skills, but most programmers are suitable for the role once they have
                gained the necessary skills. I do not believe I am as suitable for this role as others though as I am
                usually a software engineer and would be bias towards this role. However, I do wish to bring more focus
                on the testing side of the project and making sure to better provide for future testing.

                all aspects of a project, and work closely with a team of engineers, developers, and other stakeholders
                to ensure that the project is completed on time and within budget. They usually focus on the more
                business side of the project and therefore I try and stray away from this role and focus more on the
                engineering side. Complications are usually interpersonal with this role and therefore requires time
                managment and communication which I am usually "too direct" with.

                defining the strategy and roadmap for their product line, as well as gathering and prioritizing product
                and customer requirements. Since this management is more engineering focused, I am more suitable for the

                They work with software developers and other stakeholders to ensure that the software is ready for
                release, and coordinate the release process to minimize downtime and disruption. This is more testing
                focused like the QA engineer but more business focused, making me less suitable for the role. Challenges
                of time management and communication are clearly present and inevitable and so I would need to ensure
                the release product is stable and ready for release.
