                            &emsp;This idea was considered as I wanted to use Artificial Intelligence to help improve
                            everyday lives and this is a highly useful idea for a common problem. However, opinions
                            disagreed on the focus of the project as I thought it was too narrowly focused on only
                            drowsiness and prevention of such as well as being hard to publish requiring physical
                            harcware to complete which is impossible to give to the general public in our current
                            situation. As I wanted to work on a project that has a chance to be shared with humanity, I
                            decided to leave this idea.

                            is a highly common idea and would be hard to implement to work successfully. The idea
                            targets less of the general public and more of the experts, leading to requirement of a
                            higher funcioning AI and higher difficulty in publication and marketing. The success of the
                            project is unpredictable and due to the risk associated with the project for a minimal
                            audience, I decided to leave this idea.

                            a clear solution as it is difficult to find a restraunt that satisfies everyone's needs and
                            most people would rather use the already commonly built in category feature to find a close
                            restraunt. Due to these issues, I decided to leave this idea.

                            Competition already exists with this idea that is already targeted towards the general

                            marketed to the general public. However, the project is difficult to publish as it requires

                            possibility of success in publishing and users. However, the project doesn't have much
                            demand as the school website and club websites already exist and are already used by the
                            general public. As multiple school websites has already been created in the past, I decided
                            to leave this idea.

                            therefore be published. However, in order for the project to be completed, it would require
                            large funds for the hardware and there is little software, causing it to be limited to only
                            this school. Due to the limiations for branching out to other schools and therfore
                            benefiting humanity more, I decided to leave this idea.

                            to be able to do effectively as code converters are incredibly hard to optimize. As it is
                            highly likely this project may not be able to be published, I decided to leave this idea.

                The idea we eventually settled on is creating an application to allow users to generate Artificial
                Intelligence based on simple parameters. This follows along the path of using AI to help the general
                public. Despite having high competition, this doesn't target the experts of the community but instead
                the beginners who want to learn and create basic AI. This opens up the possibility of having more
                beginner programmers use AI in various programs without the complexity of large AI libraries, allowing
                both them and the general public to learn and reap the benefits of AI.
