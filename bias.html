                >Cognitive bias is common in our daily lives and affects every decision we make throughout the day. This
                is a common problem throughout our lives, and understanding it is vital in making objective decisions
                that can best solve it. In software development, this skill is vital since the production of an
                efficient product is crucial and the diversity of the users emphasizes the need to be as objective as
                possible. This essay focuses on cognitive biases, their effect on software development in general, and
                ways to counter them.</span

            <span class="c0"
                >Confirmation bias is one of the most common biases in our daily lives and probably the most famous.
                People tend to trust themselves more, and therefore the way we intake information is warped to follow
                their interests. For example, a common effect of this is Self-Serving bias, where we make decisions that
                serve ourselves than consider others (Ruhl, 2021). To counter this, it is important to focus on other
                opinions and not ignore them.</span

            <span class="c0"
                >In software development, a developer might believe that their idea is better since it works well with
                adult testing, but they will ignore the fact that it failed with child testing. This can be worsened as
                they follow the people supporting this while refusing to listen to the other side (Cherry, 2022). To be
                a good debater, a person must also understand and acknowledge the other side. Achieving this can help
                you see the flaws in your own ideas and improve them.

        <p class="c4">
            <span class="c0"
                >People usually fear change, and Anchoring Bias is a great example of this. We are heavily influenced by
                our first decisions. When the first idea does not work, people often branch along, attempting new ways
                to approach the problem using the same idea. To counter this, you will need to be open to new and unique
                ideas and approach the same problem from a different angle (Cherry, 2022).</span

        <p class="c4">
            <span class="c0"
                >The Einstellung Effect is similar to this, showing that people often apply their previous solutions to
                new problems. If a software developer started on a solution from scratch, they might make a highly
                efficient and simple design. However, if they used recursion to solve many previous designs of similar
                nature, they might feel recursion is the solution again, not realizing it might not always fit.
                Reflecting upon a design choice and confirming it is truly the best approach is important (Sturm,
                2020).</span

        <h2 class="c1"><span class="c3">Perception Biases</span></h2>
        <p class="c4">
            <span class="c0"
                >The Consensus Bias, more commonly known as the False Consensus Effect, warps our perception of the
                world. People will often overestimate how many people agree with their own beliefs and opinions. This
                can be particularly troublesome in controversial occurrences as people will think the majority is on
                their side (Cherry, 2022).</span
            >
        </p>
        <p class="c4">
            <span class="c0"
                >In software development, this bias would create products that would only match the developer&#39;s
                opinions due to their belief that the majority would love it. Instead of listening to other opinions,
                the developer would think that others would like their idea better and use that instead. Although you
                might see a product as simple and easy to use, the reality might be different from what you think.
                Understanding statistics and statistical bias is key to overcoming this false perception and
                understanding the true percentage of people who understand a product.</span

        <p class="c4">
            <span class="c0"
                >People often take a major influence on those around us, therefore, our interactions with others can
                subconsciously change our own opinions. An example of this is the Bandwagon Effect, where people would
                ride along the hypothetical bandwagon since everyone else is doing so. Due to this, we will believe that
                what everyone else is doing is correct without taking a second to think it over.</span

                >If multiple developers agree on one solution, other developers will be pulled to do the same thing.
                This can be common in using third-party tools where importing a library is not vital, but due to small
                consequences, developers would follow along with the popular opinion (Zelenska, 2018). Making sure to
                not let peer pressure influence you and presenting your own solution in meetings is important.</span

            <span class="c0"
                >When you are invested in something, there is a low chance you will drop it. Sunk Cost Bias, more
                commonly known as the Sunk Cost Fallacy, makes people feel that more effort and time equivalates to a
                good idea. This leads to people obsessed with using their solution they placed a lot of effort into, and
                they are not willing to just give it up (Zelenska, 2018).
                </span>

        <p class="c4">
            <span class="c0"
                >This can be a hard bias to counter, yet still prevalent throughout society. This affects software
                developers as they would often sink many hours into a product and refuse to continue to do something
                else even if the original product does not work. Logically, the simple solution is to understand where
                to stop. However, at what point do you determine that the idea will not work? There are many examples of
                people&#39;s perseverance leading to success even when society told them it would not work.</span

            <span class="c0"
                >In the end, the solution to this bias can contradict many other messages of commitment and
                perseverance. Insuring a good balance between commitment and obsession is the key to traversing this
                fine line.</span
