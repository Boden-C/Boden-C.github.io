        <p>This page is used for one single reason - as a redirect to my notes. You see, I'm trying to create a application shortcut
            straight to notes, but unfortunately it just goes to docs.google.com, not the specific file. So, instead of messing
            with the shortcut like a smart person, I decided to take me to a page to redirect again to the actual docs
            You should have been redirected. If not, then click<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/14fLTY4XwWSUEm5i8nT1nxYZ-JFnCtRq1fuYhDMQlmxQ/edit">here</a>.
            Of course, you won't be ale to see the notes unless you have permission.
