        <h2>Preffered Date Format?</h2>
        <p>
            YYYY-MM-DD (Though, I am fine and actually prefer YY-MM-DD). ISO 8106 is just...great (chronological
            sorting!). If forced to use MM/DD/YYYY or DD/MM/YYYY, I would actually prefer MM/DD/YYYY. Reasons is 1. It
            is sort of already part of the ISO format, since the most significant month and day part is the same as the
            ISO (MM/DD). 2. Due to the similarity, it sorts chronologically, though you will need to seperate the year
            into sepearte folders. In the end though, standarization triumphs. I heavily disagree with replacing the
            month number with the word abbriviation since 1. not international and 2. annoying to convert (especially
            with September, October, November, and December being not the 7, 8, 9, and 10 month), so now were stuck with
            2 heavily similar systems that doesn't even have a distinction (at least make one of them use a different
            symbol like MM-DD/YYYY and DD/MM/YYYY to seperate it) and the one that actually is distinct is not widely
            used.
